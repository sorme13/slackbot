  - if it is not on localhost you need to config **$conn** in **app.php** file
  - then you need to run app.php file to start http server
  - by starting with "/" route in your browser, you will define your slack app ( by client_id) and get authenticated in module stages
  - you need to build a slack app and install it on https://api.slack.com  and note client_id , client_secret
